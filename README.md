# Teachify
In this project I have basically made a platform using Augmented Reality to teach users using 3D models of objects. I wish to modernize the way of people learning things. This platform offers a variety of subsection such as English, Maths, Chemistry, Biology. All of these sections operate under the same premises, which involve scanning some of designated markers that are mapped to specific 3D models. Therefore, A person simply needs a camera-enabled gadget, and depending on the selected section and marker, He can view 3D model of that specific object. for its implementation, we use Bootstrap, Ar library, AR frame, GLTF model, HTML and CSS.
